## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

### Tech Stack

  * **UI**: [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) with Material 3.
  * **Asynchronous Programming**: [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) and [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html).
  * **Dependency Injection**: [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).
  * **Networking**: [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) & [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/).
  * **Data Parsing**: [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) (for JSON) and a custom CSV parser.
  * **Database**: [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for caching and watchlist storage.
  * **Navigation**: [Jetpack Navigation for Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation).

### Architecture

  * **Clean Architecture**: Follows a clear separation of concerns between UI, Domain, and Data layers.
  * **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: For separating UI logic from business logic.
  * **MVI-like State Management**: The UI is a function of a single `State` object, and all user actions are handled as `Events`.
  * **Repository Pattern**: A single source of truth for all application data.
